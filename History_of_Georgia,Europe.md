> The nation of Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო sakartvelo) 
> was first unified as a kingdom under the Bagrationi dynasty in 1008 AD, 
> arising from several successor states of the ancient kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia. 
> 
> The Kingdom of Georgia flourished during the 11th and 12th centuries 
> under King David IV of Georgia and Queen Tamar the Great. 
> 
> It fell to the Mongol invasion by 1243 
> but saw restoration of its former strength under the leadership of George V the Brilliant. 
> Throughout the Middle Ages, Georgia was one of the preeminent powers of the Eastern Orthodox world. 
>
> Facing relentless invasions from much larger empires, 
> by 1490 Georgia finally collapsed into several petty kingdoms and principalities, 
> which throughout the Early Modern period feuded with one another 
> and struggled to defend themselves against external threats, 
> such as Ottoman and Persian encroachment. 
> 
> This prompted Georgian monarchs to increasingly seek an alliance with the Russian Empire, 
> their Orthodox Christian neighbor to the north, 
> culminating in the annexation of Georgia by the Russian Empire beginning in 1801.
>
> Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, 
> Georgia emerged as an independent republic under German protection. 
> However, this was cut short by Russia's violation of the Treaty of Moscow 
> and the Red Army invasion of Georgia, which ended the country's sovereingty 
> and transformed it into a Soviet Republic until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 
> 
> The current republic of Georgia has been independent since 1991. 
> For much of the 21st century, Georgia pursued a strongly pro-Western foreign policy, 
> introducing a series of reforms aimed at integration into the European Union and NATO. 
> 
> This Western orientation led to worsening relations with Russia, culminating in the Russo-Georgian War.
